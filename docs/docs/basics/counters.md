# Counters

Counters can be organized and sorted within the list. Drag and drop a counter to re-arrange it.

Counters can be edited by clicking on the counter.

## Create a Counter

You can create a counter by clicking on the "New counter" button. You can use the keyboard shortcut **n** when in the app.

### Setting Targets

Targets can be set as minimum achievement and maintenance level, in order to differentiate between counters that are meeting or above expectations and which need to be worked on.

The app will display the counters in different colors to represent this:

- Below expectations (< 100% more than target): Yellow
- Meeting expectations (100%-500 more than target%): Green
- Exceeding expectations (> 500% more than target): Blue

The tallying method affects how targets are displayed. Counter increments will be tallied based on the selected method in a trailing manner. For example, if "Sum 7 days" is selected for a counter, that counter will sum up all increments up to 7 days ago. If there are no additional increments, the tallied number will drop to zero over time.

By setting a tally method and a target, you can monitor and prioritize behaviours to execute at a glance, based on the above colour coding of counter targets.

The following tally methods are available:

- Sum by 1 day
- Sum by 3 days
- Sum by 7 days
- Sum by 30 days
- Sum by 90 days

## Editing a Counter

Counters can be edited at any time by clicking on a counter. Editing a counter will not affect the counter history.

## Archiving a Counter

Archiving counters allows you to preserve your counter history while keeping it out of sight. For behaviours that are currently irrelevant to your life, we recommend archiving them to ensure that your workspace is clutter free.

Archived counters can always be unarchived and placed back into your workspace.

## Deleting a Counter

In the unlikely event that you would like to remove a counter and its history, you can directly delete the counter. This is not recommended as all counter history will be lost **permanently** and you wil not be able to recover it. We recommend archiving counters where possible.
