# Introduction

**Done3** is project management app for Google Workspace that improves and integrates Google Workspace apps, while also adding additional features.

The main goals of this app:

1. To interop with official Google mobile and web apps
2. To improve on the individual UX of each integrated app
3. To be the de-facto project management tool for Google Workspace, similar to how Microsoft Project works for O365.

You can join the private alpha of Done3 by sending an email to <a href="mailto:ty@tzeyiing.com" />.

Done3 requires a Google Workspace account, and will not work for a free Google account. For security and transparency, Done3 is fully open-sourced.

## Pricing

Done3 is free to use during private alpha until public release.

The expected pricing is as follows:

|                         | **Free** | **Solo**  | **Team**                                                        |
| ----------------------- | -------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Price**               | -        | $10/month | $25/month                                                       |
| **Max Workspace Users** | 1        | 1         | Unlimited <small> <br/> 5 included, then +$5/user/month</small> |

Prices are in USD.

```
